# 🧠 Agent Brain Analysis: How Does the AI Think?

## Current System: CNN Policy Network

### Architecture Overview

```
INPUT GRID (30×30)
    ↓
ONE-HOT ENCODING (10 channels)
    Each pixel → 10-dim vector [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
    ↓
╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
║   CONVOLUTIONAL LAYERS               ║
║   (Feature Extraction)               ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════╝
    ↓
Conv2D(64 filters, 3×3 kernel)
    • Learns LOCAL patterns
    • Example: Edges, corners, small shapes
    • Receptive field: 3×3 pixels
    ↓
Conv2D(128 filters, 3×3 kernel)
    • Learns MID-LEVEL patterns

    • Receptive field: 5×5 pixels
    ↓
Conv2D(256 filters, 3×3 kernel)
    • Learns HIGH-LEVEL patterns
    • Example: Larger structures, symmetries
    • Receptive field: 7×7 pixels
    ↓
╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
║   ACTION HEADS                       ║
║   (Decision Making)                  ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════╝
    ↓
PAINT HEAD: "Where should I paint what color?"
    Conv2D → (10, 30, 30) = probability map for each color

RESIZE HEAD: "Should I resize the grid?"
    Global pooling → FC → [enlarge_h, enlarge_w, shrink_h, shrink_w]
```

## What the Agent Actually Learns

### 1. **Spatial Patterns** ✅

The CNN learns to recognize:
- **Local features**: "Red pixel next to blue pixel"
- **Shapes**: "This looks like a square"
- **Symmetry**: "Left side mirrors right side"
- **Color gradients**: "Colors transition from blue to red"

**Example Learning:**
```
Input Pattern:        What CNN Learns:
■ ■ □ □              "Red pixels on left →
■ ■ □ □               Blue pixels should appear on right"
```

### 2. **Pixel-Level Transformations** ✅

The agent learns mappings:
- "Copy this pattern to another location"
- "Fill empty spaces with color X"
- "Mirror this pattern"

**Example:**
```
Human demo:          Agent learns:
Input:  ■ □          "When I see ■ next to □,
Output: ■ ■           change □ to ■"
```

### 3. **Reactive Behavior** ✅

Agent learns: **state → action** mappings
- "In THIS configuration, do THIS action"
- Direct stimulus-response
- No explicit reasoning

---

## What the Agent CANNOT Learn ❌

### 1. **Abstract Reasoning** ❌

**Cannot understand:**
- "Find all objects and count them"
- "Apply rule X to each object independently"
- "If condition A, then do B, else do C"

**Why?** CNNs don't have symbolic reasoning capability.

**Example ARC puzzle that fails:**
```
Rule: "Count objects and repeat pattern that many times"
Input: 2 objects → Output should have 2 copies

CNN sees:     What it should understand:
■ □ ● □       1. Detect objects (2 of them)
              2. Count them (2)
              3. Apply repetition (2×)

But CNN only sees: "Pixels in certain positions"
```

### 2. **Object Detection** ❌

**Cannot:**
- Segment the grid into discrete objects
- Track objects across transformations
- Understand object properties (size, shape, color)

**Why?** No object-centric representation.

**Example:**
```
Puzzle: "Rotate each object 90° clockwise"

Human thinking:
  Step 1: Find objects ■ and ●
  Step 2: Rotate each one
  Step 3: Place back

CNN thinking:
  "I see pixels at (x,y). I'll paint more pixels."
  No concept of "object"!
```

### 3. **Compositional Reasoning** ❌

**Cannot:**
- Break complex tasks into subtasks
- "First do X, then do Y, then do Z"
- Chain multiple transformations

**Why?** Single forward pass = single action. No planning.

### 4. **Generalization** ❌ (Limited)

**Struggles with:**
- Novel grid sizes (trained on 30×30, fails on 15×15)
- Novel color combinations
- Novel pattern types not in training data

**Why?** Overfits to training distribution.

## Technical Deep Dive

### What Each Layer Represents

**Layer 1 (64 filters):**
```
Filter 1: Detects vertical edges   ║
Filter 2: Detects horizontal edges ═
Filter 3: Detects corners         ┐
Filter 4: Detects color boundaries
...
Filter 64: Some other local pattern
```

**Layer 2 (128 filters):**
```
Combines Layer 1 features:
Filter 1: "Red square" = corners + red boundaries
Filter 2: "Blue line" = horizontal edge + blue
Filter 3: "Symmetry axis" = mirrored patterns
...
```

**Layer 3 (256 filters):**
```
High-level combinations:
Filter 1: "Repeating pattern"
Filter 2: "Grid structure"
Filter 3: "Filled region"
...
```

### How Training Works

**Behavioral Cloning (Supervised Learning):**

```python
For each human demonstration step:
    1. Show agent the grid state
    2. Agent predicts: "What action would human take?"
    3. Compare with actual human action
    4. Compute error (cross-entropy loss)
    5. Update CNN weights to reduce error
```

**What gets optimized:**
```
Loss = -log P(human_action | state)

Agent learns: "In state S, human usually does action A"
```

**NOT learning:**
- "Why did human do that action?"
- "What is the underlying rule?"
- "How would this generalize?"

---

## Visualization: Agent's "Mental Model"

### Human Mental Model (What WE do)
```
INPUT GRID
   ↓
PERCEPTION: "I see 3 red squares and 2 blue circles"
   ↓
UNDERSTANDING: "The rule is: fill blue circles with red"
   ↓
PLANNING: "I'll paint each blue circle red, one by one"
   ↓
EXECUTION: Click, click, done!
```

### CNN Agent's Mental Model (What IT does)
```
INPUT GRID
   ↓
FEATURE EXTRACTION: [0.3, 0.7, ..., 0.1] (256-dim vector)
   ↓
ACTION PREDICTION: [0.001, 0.02, 0.98, ...] (9004-dim probabilities)
   ↓
EXECUTION: Pick action with highest probability
```

**No understanding, just pattern matching!**

## Why This is Actually a HUGE Problem for ARC

### ARC Requires:

1. **Abstraction**: "What is the general rule?"
2. **Object reasoning**: "What are the objects?"
3. **Program synthesis**: "What program generates this output?"
4. **Few-shot learning**: "Learn from 2-3 examples"
5. **Compositionality**: "Combine simple rules"

### Our CNN Provides:

1. ❌ Pixel-level pattern matching
2. ❌ Memorization of demonstrations
3. ❌ No explicit reasoning
4. ✅ Fast inference
5. ✅ Differentiable (can train with backprop)

---

## Better Approaches for ARC

### 1. **Neuro-Symbolic Architecture**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  NEURAL PERCEPTION                  │
│  (CNN/Transformer)                  │
│  Extracts: objects, colors, shapes  │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SYMBOLIC REASONING                 │
│  (Program Synthesis / Logic)        │
│  Infers: rules, transformations     │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PROGRAM EXECUTOR                   │
│  Applies inferred program to input  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. **Hierarchical Policy**

```
HIGH-LEVEL POLICY: "What operation to perform?"
   Options: [rotate, mirror, flood_fill, color_map, ...]
   ↓
MID-LEVEL POLICY: "What object to operate on?"
   Options: [object_1, object_2, all_objects, ...]
   ↓
LOW-LEVEL POLICY: "Execute the operation"
   Neural network performs actual pixel manipulation
```

### 3. **Attention-Based Transformer**

```
INPUT: Grid + Previous Actions
   ↓
SELF-ATTENTION: "Which parts of grid are related?"
   Learns: object boundaries, symmetries, patterns
   ↓
CROSS-ATTENTION: "How do input/output relate?"
   Learns: transformation rules
   ↓
OUTPUT: Next action
```

### 4. **Program Synthesis with DSL**

```python
# Domain Specific Language for ARC
def solve_puzzle(input_grid):
    # Agent learns to generate this program!
    objects = detect_objects(input_grid)

    for obj in objects:
        if obj.color == BLUE:
            obj.rotate(90)
        if obj.size < 3:
            obj.fill(RED)

    return compose(objects)
```

Agent learns to **write programs**, not just paint pixels!

## Our Current Agent: Strengths & Weaknesses

### ✅ Strengths
- **Fast to train**: 5-10 minutes for 100 epochs
- **Fast inference**: Milliseconds per action
- **No LLM needed**: Runs offline
- **Simple architecture**: Easy to debug
- **Proven approach**: Works for Atari, robotics, etc.

### ❌ Weaknesses
- **No abstraction**: Can't understand rules
- **No object reasoning**: Sees pixels, not objects
- **Limited generalization**: Needs many diverse demos
- **No planning**: Single-step reactive
- **No compositionality**: Can't chain operations
- **Overfitting risk**: Memorizes demos instead of learning rules

---

## Expected Performance

### What Our CNN Agent CAN Solve (30-40% of ARC)

**Simple pixel-level transformations:**
- ✅ Fill region with color
- ✅ Copy pattern to location
- ✅ Mirror grid horizontally/vertically
- ✅ Simple color substitution
- ✅ Extend pattern by repetition

**Example:**
```
Input:  ■ □     Output: ■ ■
        □ □             ■ ■
Rule: "Copy ■ to all positions"
→ CNN can learn this!
```

### What It CANNOT Solve (60-70% of ARC)

**Abstract reasoning puzzles:**
- ❌ Count objects and use count
- ❌ Apply different rules to different objects
- ❌ Conditional logic (if-then-else)
- ❌ Relative positioning ("largest object")
- ❌ Arithmetic operations (add, multiply)

**Example:**
```
Input:  ■ ● ●    Output: ■ ■ ■
                         ● ● ●
Rule: "Count ● objects (2), create that many rows"
→ CNN cannot understand counting!
```

1. **Collect 100+ diverse demos** - More data helps
2. **Augment data** - Rotate, mirror demonstrations
3. **Larger network** - More layers, more filters
4. **Curriculum learning** - Easy → Hard puzzles

### For Better Performance
1. **Add object detection module**
   - Segment grid into objects first
   - Then reason about objects

2. **Hierarchical architecture**
   - High-level: Choose operation
   - Low-level: Execute operation

3. **Attention mechanisms**
   - Focus on relevant grid regions
   - Learn object relationships

4. **Program synthesis**
   - Learn to generate programs (DSL)
   - More generalizable than pixels

5. **Neuro-symbolic hybrid**
   - Neural perception
   - Symbolic reasoning
   - Best of both worlds!
